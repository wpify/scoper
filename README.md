# WPify Scoper - A scoper for WordPress plugins and themes

Using Composer in your WordPress plugin or theme can benefit from that. But it also comes with a danger of conflicts
with dependencies of other plugins or themes. Luckily, a great tool
called [PHP Scoper](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper) adds all your needed dependencies to your namespace to prevent
conflicts. Unfortunately, the configuration is non-trivial, and for that reason, we created the Composer plugin to make
scoping easy in WordPress projects.

The main issue with PHP Scoper is that it also scopes global functions, constants and classes. Usually, that is what you
want, but that also means that WordPress functions, classes and constants will be scoped. This Composer plugin solves
that. It has an up-to-date database of all WordPress and WooCommerce symbols that we want to keep unscoped.

## Requirements

* wpify/scoper:**3.1**
   * PHP 7.4 || 8.0
* wpify/scoper:**3.2**
   * PHP >= 8.1

## Usage

1. The configuration requires creating `composer-deps.json` file, that has exactly same structure like `composer.json`
   file, but serves only for scoped dependencies. Dependencies that you don't want to scope comes to `composer.json`.
2. Add `extra.wpify-scoper.prefix` to you `composer.json`, where you can specify the namespace, where your dependencies
   will be in. All other config options (`folder`, `globals`, `composerjson`, `composerlock`) are optional.
3. The easiest way how to use the scoper on development environment is to install WPify Scoper as a dev dependency.
   After each `composer install` or `composer update`, all the dependencies specified in `composer-deps.json` will be
   scoped for you.
4. Add a `config.platform` option in your composer.json and composer-deps.json. This settings will make sure that the
   dependencies will be installed with the correct PHP version.

**Example of `composer.json` with its default values**

```json
{
  "config": {
    "platform": {
      "php": "8.0"
    }
  },
  "require-dev": {
    "wpify/scoper": "^2.4",
    "example/dependency": "^1.0"
  },
  "extra": {
    "wpify-scoper": {
      "prefix": "MyNamespaceForDeps",
      "folder": "deps",
      "globals": [
        "wordpress",
        "woocommerce"
      ],
      "composerjson": "composer-deps.json",
      "composerlock": "composer-deps.lock"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Scoped dependencies will be in `deps` folder of your project. You must include the scoped autoload alongside with the
   composer autoloader.

5. After that, you can use your dependencies with the namespace.

**Example PHP file:**

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/deps/scoper-autoload.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

new \MyNamespaceForDeps\Example\Dependency();
```

## Deployment

When you want to deploy the project, you need to scope your dependencies, but not to include dev depencencies. That can
be achieved by following commands:

```bash
composer install --optimize-autoloader
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

The first command installs all the dependencies and run the scoper, the second command removes dev dependencies
including the scoper. After that, you can deploy the files manually.

### Deployment with Gitlab CI

To use WPify Scoper with Gitlab CI, you can add the following job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
composer:
  stage: .pre
  image: composer:2
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - $CI_PROJECT_DIR/deps
      - $CI_PROJECT_DIR/vendor
    expire_in: 1 week
  script:
    - PATH=$(composer global config bin-dir --absolute --quiet):$PATH
    - composer global config --no-plugins allow-plugins.wpify/scoper true
    - composer global require wpify/scoper
    - composer install --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-dev
```

### Deployment with Github Actions

To use WPify Scoper with Github Actions, you can add the following action:

```yaml
name: Build vendor

jobs:
   install:
      runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

      steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Cache Composer dependencies
           uses: actions/cache@v2
           with:
              path: /tmp/composer-cache
              key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/composer.lock') }}

         - name: Install composer
           uses: php-actions/composer@v6
           with:
              php_version: 8.0
              php_extensions: json
              version: 2
              dev: yes
              progress: no
              args: --optimize-autoloader

         - name: Remove dev dependencies
           run: |
              composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

         - name: Archive plugin artifacts
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
           with:
              name: vendor
              path: |
                 deps/
                 vendor/
```

## Advanced configuration

PHP Scoper has plenty
of [configuration options](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration). You
can modify this configuration array by creating `scoper.custom.php` file in root of your project. The file should
contain `customize_php_scoper_config` function, where the first parameter is the preconfigured configuration array. Expected output is
valid [PHP Scoper configuration array](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#configuration).

**Example `scoper.custom.php` file**

```php
<?php

function customize_php_scoper_config( array $config ): array {
    $config['patchers'][] = function( string $filePath, string $prefix, string $content ): string {
        if ( strpos( $filePath, 'guzzlehttp/guzzle/src/Handler/CurlFactory.php' ) !== false ) {
            $content = str_replace( 'stream_for($sink)', 'Utils::streamFor()', $content );
        }
        
        return $content;
    };
    
    return $config;
}
```
